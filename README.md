# Weathrly

Context

It’s important to know what Mother Nature is going to throw at you each day – what if you wear flip flops because it’s sunny and 65 degrees in the morning and then it snows all afternoon (this is Colorado, after all).

Web developers constantly live in the context of the web, so learning progressively leads to an interaction with a web-api. Ultimately project was intended to be a preview for what the real world is going to look like for most of the class. Data is important and thats what the API provides. As web-developers we are giving value to that data by visualizing and organizing that data for a user base.

Since this project posed as offering our first real interactions with ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, and managing the state of the application, we were told to use an API written up specifically for this project to keep the conceptual overload to a minimum.
